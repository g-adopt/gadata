"""Cache port: the dataset-cache interface the application layer depends on.

The concrete cache (hash-named GeoParquet files + a provenance manifest, with
the hybrid freshness logic from DESIGN) lives in the infrastructure layer. The
application layer asks only: do we have a fresh copy of this query, and if so
give it to me; otherwise let me fetch and then store it. The freshness decision
(conditional GET, fingerprint, TTL, ``force_refresh``) is the cache's concern,
not the use case's.
