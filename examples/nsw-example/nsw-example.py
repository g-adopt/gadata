"""Pull all NSW groundwater data from the NGIS state core.

The NSW core is the dense in-package source: every borehole the Bureau of
Meteorology holds for the state, plus its downhole stratigraphy, earth-material
and construction logs (with per-interval AHD elevations the GA WFS lacks). We
query the whole state by handing NGISClient the registered NSW extent as the
box, then load each log kind and export tidy one-row-per-interval tables.

The first run downloads and optimises the NSW gdb once (a few minutes, several
hundred MB under GADATA_NGIS_DIR); every run after that filters the cached fast
DB in memory, offline.

Run:  ~/Workplace/python3.12/bin/python3.12 examples/nsw-example/nsw-example.py
